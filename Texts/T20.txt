Marco Pave and the Politicization of Memphis Hip-Hop
Art is always already personal and political. Memphis native Marco Pave's recently released mixtape, Obscure Reality, and his community work in and beyond his neighborhood, exemplify this dual function of art, as well as the possibilities of art to reflect and instigate social change. The 21-year-old rapper operates squarely in the tradition of Memphis hip-hop artists before him, who have frequently used their work to tell untold stories, reckon with the ghosts of King and civil rights, and highlight the city's current social position. Yet, as part of the center of a bourgeoning movement of young creatives and intellectuals speaking back to the city's unequal power relationships, Pave marshals his art for direct action and transformation of his neighborhood and city.
Smatterings of the usual misogynoir that characterizes most rap music (and our society more broadly) are certainly present. But so also are gems of urban wisdom like reflections on being an artist, battling for one's dreams, his relationship with his infant son and his son's mother, and conversations with his mother. The signature Memphis rap musical sound-crunk chants and staccato rhythm to which we have popularly become accustomed is absent here, but like many independent hip-hop artists on the Memphis scene, that is precisely the point.
