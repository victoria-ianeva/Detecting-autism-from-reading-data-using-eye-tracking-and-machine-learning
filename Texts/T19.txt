Pub Rock
A general rule for pub rock patrons is that the quality of music will be in inverse proportion to the quality of the beer (except at Finsbury Park's Sir George Robey where an excellent music policy comes complete with a decent pint of Guinness). Another rule of thumb is that if the act is obliged to rest their microphone stand and amplifiers on beer crates instead of the stage, it will be a good evening. There are two types of pub rock occasions: those, like the one described above, where the band is likely to suffer from agrophobia; and those where the pub is so crowded, death through asphixiation seems to be the only way to get out. There is no half-way house. If it's a comfortable evening's entertainment you're after, stay at home with the video. Dress varies, but will never be up.
