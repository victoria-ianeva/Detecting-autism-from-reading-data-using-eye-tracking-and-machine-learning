Leicester City: Why Premier League title dream is possible
''They will fall away eventually. It will never last.'' It is a common view on Leicester City's position as Premier League leaders. ''If Leicester win the Premier League, I'll do the first Match of the Day next season in my underwear,'' said the club's ex-striker Gary Lineker last week.
Following victory at Everton, the Foxes are top at Christmas. So has the Match of the Day presenter made a hasty Twitter statement? BBC Sport spoke to fans and former players to look at why Leicester could become champions of England for the first time. 
''Hearing the roar from the crowd makes us believe anything is possible,'' top scorer Jamie Vardy wrote on a clapstick given to every fan at the home game against champions Chelsea, a match Leicester won 2-1. Results make his words feel far from empty. The Foxes have scored more goals than any other side in the league and only Liverpool can boast more tackles this season. 
''You can tell something special is going on,'' season-ticket holder Adam Tomlinson told BBC Sport. ''At the moment around Leicester we are going into every game thinking we can get three points out of this.''
''They play like a team who have no fear and nothing to lose, who are positive in everything they do,'' former Leicester striker Steve Claridge told BBC Sport. ''You have to start taking them seriously.''
